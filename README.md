## Dataset Description

This dataset contains augmented videos collected to evaluate systems for detecting contradictory virtual content in augmented reality (AR). Each video captures a real-world AR scene. The dataset is structured around two key dimensions:

  - **AR Application**: what kind of AR scene is presented in the video. We demonstrate 5 typical applications: Indoor Navigation, Outdoor Navigation, Safety Inspection, Smart Apartment, Smart Retail.

  - **Contradcition Status**: whether the virtual content in the video are contradictory with each other. Each video is labeled as either "contradictory" or "not contradictory".
